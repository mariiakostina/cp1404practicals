# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

For simple task my estimates was better than for complex tasks. For complex tasks I underestimated time in most of the cases.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I think changed for the better because when you constantly do complex tasks and learn new topics, those things that were previously considered as difficult are now easy. 

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
- It learned me to plan the estimated time 
- Learned to do the step by step work making the complex task more simple

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
 I learned about my strength and weaknesses. I learned that there are so many different approaches except mine on the issue.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
- I saw new features that I could implement for my future works
- Also I saw mistakes that sometimes face to in my work, but do not take enough consideration. Now, I changed my mind.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac_06 Code Review](https://github.com/ZhangGuoyang1/prac_06_feedback/pull/3/commits/40dd0314c5aa79824f7073a32c1f7a88292076be)
- I have an adequate code review
### Explanation

I encouraged to use more descriptive methods names instead of just add, add what?
I suggested more error-checking, so I encouraged for input validations to avoid illogical values like negative fuel. Adding such checks contributes to more reliable code. 

### Good Code Review 2
[Prac_07 Code Review](https://github.com/ShikunBai/CP1404-Practicals/pull/3)
- I have an adequate code review
### Explanation
I encouraged proper documentation practices by suggesting to use doctrings for classes and methods. 


## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I would add some debugging tasks where the student have to fix the code, which would improve problem-solving skills and students could take into consideration what is wrong and would better write their codes and also read the unknown codes. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
I learned how to work well with functions which I struggle with in the previous course, now I am proud with myself. 
I am good at structuring the code and write well-structured code.
